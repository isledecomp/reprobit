# Command-line guide

`rbit` keeps project intent, local machine configuration, building, and
verification separate. Commands write plain text by default, and long work uses
one live progress line in an interactive terminal. Pass `--format ndjson`
(before or after the subcommand) when CI or another program needs stable
machine-readable events; see [Machine-readable output](#machine-readable-output).
Pass `--quiet` (before or after the subcommand) to silence text-mode progress:
phase starts, heartbeats, completion lines, unit counts, and the interactive
progress display. Results, warnings, errors, and the context line written when
a phase fails still print. `--quiet` does not change ndjson output, because
machine readers rely on receiving every event. Interactive terminals and saved
logs use the same plain-language phase names. Exact internal step IDs remain
available in failure details, rebuild explanations, and ndjson. Output is plain
by design: no colour, no shell completion, and no terminal control beyond the
transient progress line.

Printed follow-up commands use POSIX shell quoting on macOS and Linux, and
PowerShell quoting on Windows. Machine events also carry the unquoted `argv`
array for callers that launch a process directly.

This page has one section per command, in the order `rbit --help` lists them.
It explains what commands do and how they fit together. The exact flags and
defaults are generated from the parser into
[cli-reference.md](cli-reference.md). [Getting started](getting-started.md)
owns the narrative walk from a bare CMake project to a verified build, while
the focused workflow guides own discovery, CMake import, and CI behavior.

For an existing project, the everyday path is short:

```console
rbit status .
rbit build .
rbit verify . --report-dir build/reprobit-report
```

`status` names the next missing setup item. `build` is the fast incremental
developer loop; `verify` always starts fresh and writes the trust report. After
editing a file that already belongs to the project—including a shared header
used by many source files—use `rbit repair .`. Run `setup` once on each machine
to prepare and remember its local compiler.

Every command that takes a project accepts it as a positional argument, such as
`rbit status .`.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: progress events</summary>

Redirected logs and CI receive phase starts, heartbeats, completed units, and a
final event, so a compiler or verifier never goes silently idle. Producer work
and overall workflow progress use separate event types. Discovery compiler
totals include declaration experiments only for the source files selected by
the committed overlay graph. In text mode, `--quiet` drops this whole channel
(a heartbeat exists to prove liveness, which is exactly what `--quiet` opts out
of) and keeps only the failure context line; in ndjson mode the events are
always streamed.

</details>

## rbit init

Start a ReproBit project. Name the real CMake target when initializing and
repeat `--target` for projects that produce more than one binary:

```console
rbit init . --target program
```

`init` creates the project entry point, adds root ignore entries for ReproBit's
local state, and creates an empty, explicitly incomplete source record, so a
new project cannot appear build-ready before its real files are reviewed. The
default rebuilt-output and reference filenames follow each target name. For
target-specific custom paths, repeat `--artifact TARGET=PATH` or
`--oracle TARGET=PATH`; for a single target the `TARGET=` prefix is optional:

```console
rbit init . --target program --artifact build/app.exe --oracle reference/program.exe
```

The `--logical-source`, `--logical-build`, and `--logical-toolchain` DOS
paths are the compiler-visible roots recorded in `reprobit.toml` (defaults
`R:\source`, `R:\build`, `R:\toolchain`); see [platforms](platforms.md)
before changing them.

## rbit setup

Prepare the compiler and this machine for a project:

```console
rbit setup .
# Or use an existing installation:
rbit setup . --toolchain-root /opt/toolchains/msvc42
```

`setup` selects or downloads the compiler, authenticates it, creates the project
lock when absent, verifies an existing lock, and probes the host backend. It
remembers the local compiler path only after those checks pass, so a failed
attempt preserves the previous default. That is the normal workflow on macOS,
Linux, and Windows. It ends with the same checklist `status` prints, so a finished
machine setup and a still-incomplete project are reported together. Machine
setup and project setup are separate: `rbit setup` can finish installing and
checking the compiler while `rbit status` still lists missing project files.
Exit status 1 means a backend
check failed.

## rbit doctor

`doctor` is the read-only diagnostic underneath setup. It checks the selected
host backend and the compiler chosen for the project against its saved lock.
That is the path passed on the command line, set in the environment, remembered
by `setup`, or found in the standard location:

```console
rbit doctor .
rbit doctor . --toolchain-root /opt/toolchains/msvc42
```

Add `--execute-probe` to execute the bounded Wine probe on POSIX. On native
Windows the opt-in probe creates a fresh, verified logon session and defines a
temporary drive only in that session. The real producer starts suspended inside
a nested Job Object, and the probe requires its descendant to observe the same
drive. The mapping is removed only after that complete producer tree exits.
Without a project, `--toolchain-root` also needs `--profile`.

## rbit toolchain provision

Download and authenticate a supported compiler outside any project:

```console
rbit toolchain provision msvc_4_2
```

Automatic acquisition is currently available only for Microsoft Visual C++ 4.2.
The installation goes to this platform's standard user location unless
`--destination` says otherwise, and its path is remembered unless `--no-save`
is given. `rbit setup` runs the same provisioning automatically when a project
needs it, so this command is mainly for machines prepared before any project
exists (the advanced declaration-discovery example uses it).

## rbit toolchain lock

Record the exact compiler files this project expects. `setup` creates the lock
automatically; the lower-level command remains available for CI images and
unusual manual installations that need explicit runtime files:

```console
rbit toolchain lock . --toolchain-root /opt/toolchains/msvc42 \
  --runtime-file wine/x86/cl \
  --runtime-file wine/x86/rc \
  --runtime-file wine/x86/link \
  --runtime-file wine/x86/lib \
  --runtime-file wine/x86/wine-msvc.sh
```

An existing project always writes the compiler lock path declared in
`reprobit.toml`; `--output` is only for bootstrapping a directory that has no
project configuration yet.

The lock command hashes required compiler producers and portable include and
library tree receipts. It also writes `profile_sources`, the selected profile's
reviewed immutable repository inputs for each profile-owned installed path.
Those inputs neither prove how local bytes were acquired nor replace the exact
file and tree receipts. The authenticated provisioner and CI workflow establish
acquisition; the lock receipts establish the installed content. Platform wrappers
or support files that participate in execution must be named explicitly with
repeatable `--runtime-file` arguments and remain outside `profile_sources`.
The five paths above are the complete portable runtime set for MSVC 4.2 on
POSIX. `wine/x86/msvcenv.sh` is used only while CMake configures an import or
refresh tree; direct ReproBit builds do not execute it, so the provisioner
authenticates it but the portable runtime lock does not include it.
Committed lock paths are relative to the supplied toolchain root; the physical
root itself remains local configuration. `rbit validate` rejects a registered
profile whose locked profile paths are missing, disagree with these reviewed
repository inputs, or assign an extra profile source to a wrapper path.

## rbit source preview

Show source changes and records that need review without writing:

```console
rbit source preview .
```

`source preview` hashes the proposed Git-tracked read set without writing.
Repeat `--path` to provide an explicit complete file or tree set instead. It is
not a filter over the current record: every omitted path is reported as a
removal. Without `--path`, preview uses the selection saved by the last lock when
the manifest has one and every Git-tracked file otherwise; the `selection` line
and event field say which. Text output keeps long change lists brief; NDJSON
retains every path.

To add a new file to the reviewed source list—or remove a locked one—preview
the new list first. `repair` keeps using the exact locked list and never
silently admits another Git-tracked file. Before the first import, preview
prints the exact `source lock` command. Once CMake records exist, it normally
prints `rbit import cmake . --refresh`, carrying forward every explicit
`--path` selection and the saved CMake import options. If an older graph does
not contain those options, preview refuses to guess and asks for one ordinary
CMake re-import first.

## rbit source export

Write the reviewed effective source view used by compilers and analysis tools:

```console
rbit source export . --destination build/reprobit-debug/source
```

Source-aware tools must read the same reviewed source view as the compiler. This
matters when an intervention adds declarations or otherwise moves source lines.
The export contains project inputs admitted by the source lock, with the
reviewed source adjustments applied, plus one hidden ownership marker. It does
not contain reference binaries, compiler files, build outputs, or private run
state. Running the command again
safely replaces the prior export, including files that are no longer part of
the reviewed source view. ReproBit marks directories it creates and refreshes
only those marked exports, so it cannot replace an unrelated directory by
mistake. The destination also cannot overlap source inputs, project records,
reference binaries, or build outputs. Point the tool's source root at the
exported directory.

## rbit source lock

Safely record tracked or explicitly named source inputs:

```console
rbit source lock .
```

`source lock` publishes the set shown by `source preview` after review. A
successful lock prints the next required step—usually placing the original
binary, running the first `rbit import cmake .`, or checking `rbit status .`.
After a CMake import exists, use the refresh command printed by preview rather
than locking a changed file list separately.

Repeat `--path` to admit only the named files or trees. In a Git worktree the
selection admits the tracked files under each root, untracked files stay
invisible, and a root without tracked files is an error. The lock saves those
roots as `selection` in the source manifest, so later `source preview` and
`source lock` runs without `--path` reuse the same roots instead of re-admitting
every tracked file. Name a new `--path` set to replace the saved selection.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: source-lock safety and generated project records</summary>

`source lock` publishes the manifest and, when one exists, its build-plan
binding in one guarded transaction. Every admitted source file is checked
again, so an edit racing the lock aborts rather than saving mixed state. It does
not rewrite translation-unit, intervention, or proof checks. If those checks
became stale after a routine edit, use `rbit repair .`. The advanced
[`source regenerate`](#rbit-source-regenerate) command lets you inspect only the
mechanical changes when diagnosing a repair.

</details>

## rbit source regenerate

Advanced maintenance tool. After editing an existing project file, normally run
`rbit repair .` instead. `source regenerate` is the preview used inside the
maintenance flow; it is useful when you want to inspect mechanical record
updates without building or verifying:

```console
rbit source regenerate .          # preview only
rbit source regenerate . --apply  # apply only these mechanical changes
```

It re-renders stale records against the current bytes and can propose changes
for four record families. Staleness is decided by rendering, not by the clean
digest alone: an output whose clean bytes are unchanged but whose reviewed
operations were edited (a retuned declaration-run count, a dropped declaration)
is re-rendered and its effective digest re-derived, and every private donor
rendering is rendered again so a change in the owning unit's canonical
operations reaches the donor's pins too.

* **Source-adjustment outputs** — the clean source and newly rendered output.
* **Private donor renderings** — source prepared for one owning translation
  unit, including its reviewed adjustments.
* **Declaration donors** — their rendered source and the checked insertion
  points around a declaration.
* **Translation-unit source checks** — in both per-unit records and the build
  plan.

The human preview says what would change, prints a concise count and
per-document summary, and writes nothing. With `--format ndjson`, the
event's `changes` field contains each field-level before/after value for
tooling. `--apply` reports what it saved and writes all changed documents in
one guarded transaction that also checks the exact source bytes read by the
plan, so a concurrent edit aborts instead of committing mixed state. It then
points back to `rbit repair .` for the build and exact check.

The command fails closed when it cannot re-derive a check. It only proposes or
applies mechanical record changes: it does not lock, build, verify, or certify
the project. It remains a separate command because this read-only preview is
useful for diagnosis; `repair` already runs the same planner automatically,
then handles compiler-dependent fallout and exact verification. Prefer
`rbit repair .` unless you specifically need the intermediate view.

## rbit import cmake

Prepare and record an ordinary CMake project in one guided run. CMake is an
import and refresh input, not a build or certification runtime. For a normal
project, the initial import is one command:

```console
rbit import cmake .
```

`import cmake` derives the initial build plan, records the reference binary,
and creates empty per-source review shards. It then materializes the reviewed
source tree, performs one bounded configure—never a project build—and
atomically commits the closed graph and its initial TU review shards. It uses
**Unix Makefiles** on POSIX or the authenticated **NMake Makefiles** frontend on
native Windows, plus `compile_commands.json` and the reviewed
`reprobit-target-plan.json`. It does not edit `CMakeLists.txt`.

The guided import derives only facts it can check: target mappings, empty
initial intervention/proof records, the protected reference digest, and the
compiler/linker commands CMake exposes. It does not guess entropy
interventions. `rbit status .` keeps every missing item visible afterwards.

The simplest setup passes the real CMake target name to `rbit init --target`, so
the default rebuilt-output and reference filenames follow it. Use
`--target program=your_cmake_target` during import only when the ReproBit ID
intentionally differs and its declared artifact still matches the real output:

```console
rbit init . --target program --artifact build/app.exe --oracle reference/program.exe
# After setup, source review, and placing the reference binary:
rbit import cmake . --target program=app
```

If the import fails, the generated scaffold is removed and the diagnostic
workspace is retained for inspection.

After adding, removing, or renaming source files in an imported project, begin
with `rbit source preview .`. When the change is compatible, preview points
directly to `rbit import cmake . --refresh`. Refresh stages the new source list
and CMake records, preserves compatible per-source adjustments and checks,
resets changed steps, retires removed steps, verifies every target from scratch,
and publishes the records, verified outputs, and report as one complete passing
update. It refuses ambiguous compiler steps and any candidate that fails cold
verification. The saved CMake program, configuration, timeout, repeated
`--cmake-define` values, and directive inputs are replayed automatically;
explicit refresh options replace those saved values. The
[CMake workflow](cmake.md#refresh-after-adding-or-removing-source-files) gives
the full sequence.

Use `--clear-cmake-defines` or `--clear-directive-inputs` with `--refresh`
when the refreshed graph should replace one of those saved lists with no values.

Refresh accepts `--jobs`, `--initialization-timeout`, `--compile-timeout`,
`--link-timeout`, and `--cleanup-timeout` for its build from scratch. These
options require `--refresh`; `--timeout` controls the separate CMake configure.

## rbit graph configure

Create a fresh CMake metadata tree without building. Together with
`graph extract` this is the two-step form of `import cmake` for CI or unusual
projects:

```console
rbit graph configure . \
  --workspace-root .reprobit-state/import \
  --toolchain-root /opt/toolchains/msvc42 \
  --compiler-transport /opt/toolchains/msvc42/wine/x86/cl \
  --resource-transport /opt/toolchains/msvc42/wine/x86/rc \
  --cmake-define FEATURE_SET=classic
```

`graph configure` reports the exact configured/effective roots, target plan,
compile database, effective-source digest, configure log, command digest, and
duration. It also prints the complete `graph extract` command for that exact
workspace. It refuses a non-empty workspace and detects any source mutation
during CMake configuration. Repeat `--cmake-define NAME=VALUE` for ordinary
CMake cache settings; the same validation applies to guided import.

## rbit graph extract

Record direct compiler and linker steps from the CMake tree that
`graph configure` produced:

```console
rbit graph extract . \
  --configured-build-root .reprobit-state/import/build \
  --effective-source-root .reprobit-state/import/source \
  --effective-source-digest SHA256_FROM_CONFIGURE \
  --toolchain-root /opt/toolchains/msvc42 \
  --directive-input program=oldnames.lib
rbit validate .
rbit explain .
rbit cost .
```

Replace `SHA256_FROM_CONFIGURE` with the digest reported by `graph configure`.
`graph extract` reads expanded compile commands, resource rules, response files,
and link commands; converts physical paths into `${SOURCE}`, `${BUILD}`, and
`${TOOLCHAIN}` seats; rejects unbound producers and paths; and transactionally
publishes `reprobit/producer-graph.json`. Schema v3 binds the declared
direct source inputs, toolchain lock, logical-path profile, exact target set, and
terminal artifact paths; the source manifest and build plan separately bind
current source contents. Certification reloads those documents and never
executes CMake. Re-extract only when a graph input or other command/build
authority changes.
Repeat `--directive-input TARGET=LIBRARY` for reviewed linker-only library
edges discovered in COFF `.drectve` sections. The value must be a known target
and one bare library name; paths, duplicate declarations, and implicit runtime
authorization are rejected. When an edge is missing, the direct runtime emits
copy/paste-ready flags for a new explicit extraction.

## rbit validate

Check every saved project file:

```console
rbit validate .
```

`validate` loads every saved JSON file, rejects duplicate keys and IDs,
checks cross-document references and dependency cycles, compares current files
with their recorded hashes, renders declarative overlays in memory, and checks
effective TU digests. It never runs a build. It is the command that checks
source bytes against saved project records; `explain` and `cost` inspect the
committed metadata only.

## rbit cost

Show intervention cost totals:

```console
rbit cost .
```

The score measures distance from an ordinary build; see the
[cost model](costs.md) for the fixed categories and accounting rules. The text
output names the cost model version and points to `rbit explain` for the
per-intervention view.

## rbit status

Show what is ready and the next project setup step:

```console
rbit status .
```

`status` checks that each saved project file exists and that every JSON record
parses; it does not validate schemas or cross-file agreement until every file is
present (then it runs the same check as `validate`). It also checks that this
machine can find the remembered compiler and the required backend tools.
These availability checks do not launch the execution probe; use
`rbit doctor . --execute-probe` to exercise it. Rows marked `[  ]` are missing;
`[!!]` marks a file that exists but cannot be read and points to `validate`.
The exit status is 1 until every check passes.

## rbit clean

Remove inactive workspaces; cache and reports are opt-in. Successful workspaces
are removed automatically; failed ones are kept so you can diagnose them. Check
the space ReproBit manages with [`state status`](#rbit-state-status), then
preview cleanup before removing anything:

```console
rbit state status .
rbit clean . --preview
rbit clean .
```

`clean` removes inactive workspaces but keeps the reusable incremental cache and
saved reports. The following preview includes ordinary inactive-workspace
cleanup and the cache data left by older ReproBit code, and keeps the current
cache:

```console
rbit clean . --obsolete-cache --preview
```

The full-cache and saved-report selections are separate alternatives:

```console
rbit clean . --cache --preview
rbit clean . --reports --preview
```

Use `--cache` only when you intend to clear incremental and repair-search cache
entries. With no age it clears them all; use `--older-than-hours 24` to keep
recent workspaces and cache entries.
Active runs are never removed. The `--keep-workspace` option of `build`, `verify`,
`repair`, and `import cmake` changes which run workspaces are retained in the
first place (`on-failure` by default).

## rbit explain

Explain saved interventions:

```console
rbit explain .
rbit explain . --intervention intervention-id
```

`explain` lists interventions and their fixed costs; pass `--intervention ID`
to select one and print it in full. Like `cost`, it reads the committed metadata
only, so it remains useful while source bytes are being edited. A project with
no saved interventions says so explicitly. An unknown ID is an error that lists
the known IDs.

## rbit repair

Use this after editing a file in a project that already matched exactly. This is
the complete maintenance workflow, including for a shared header used by many
source files:

```console
rbit repair .
```

Repair finds all affected work, including changes that cross source-file
boundaries. It updates saved compiler choices and function records, and safely
narrows or removes old fallback records. When generated declarations affect
compiler layout, it checks both source views and tries nearby harmless layouts.
A layout change can move other compiler output, so repair rechecks that work in
later passes. It then rebuilds every target from scratch and checks the result.
There is no manual JSON or TOML recipe to write between these steps.

All work happens in a private workspace. Only an exact, trustworthy result is
published, and the changed records, verified binaries, matching debug
companions, and report are published together. If repair fails, the source edit
remains, while the previously published records and results stay unchanged.
The default report is `.reprobit-state/reports/report.html`; choose another
project-relative location when useful:

```console
rbit repair . --report-dir build/reprobit-report
```

Repair advances in trustworthy order. In each affected source build, it acts on
the earliest refusal whose input is still complete, stages a safe change, and
then analyzes the project again. Later work is rechecked from the newly valid
state on the next pass instead of being guessed from an incomplete one. A broad
header edit can therefore take several automatic passes, but still needs only
the one command. Progress names the current pass and build phase, shows elapsed
time, and carries the last completed adjustment into the next check.

If the from-scratch check exposes a remaining link layout mismatch, repair
searches nearby harmless source layouts for that target and checks again. This
also stays private, and each retry counts against the same command-wide limits.

The ordinary defaults keep searches bounded. If a report says a search budget
was exhausted, these advanced options widen it:

```console
rbit repair . --retune-radius 32 --retune-candidates 2048 \
  --candidate-limit 20000 --discovery-candidates 512 \
  --adjustment-rounds 200
```

`--retune-radius` is the farthest declaration-count distance tried per saved
compiler choice or source layout (default 8, maximum 64). `--retune-candidates`
caps nearby choices per saved compiler choice or source layout (default 64),
while `--candidate-limit` caps nearby repair choices tested by the whole command
(default 256). `--discovery-candidates`
caps fresh choices per affected source file after its saved donors are
exhausted (default 64).
`--adjustment-rounds` caps saved-guidance adjustment rounds (default 24).
Larger values can take longer, but never relax what repair may change or the
final proof. The complete limits are in the
[generated option table](cli-reference.md#rbit-repair).

For added or removed files, start with [`source preview`](#rbit-source-preview);
it prints a safe next command when one is available. For a new project that
builds but does not match yet, use [`discover grind`](#rbit-discover-grind)
instead of repair.

### Functions newly affected by an edit

When an accepted `rbit verify` or `rbit repair` completes, it remembers which
function bodies were selected. Repair uses that record to notice when an
edit also moves a function that never needed special handling before. It can add
the source file to its saved repair guidance and create the needed records
automatically; it succeeds only after every newly affected function is restored.
If no replacement is found within the default budget, raise
`--discovery-candidates` and `--candidate-limit` and rerun the same command.
Do not hand-edit project records.

Repair stops when the edit removed the function entirely, because it cannot
restore a function that is no longer present. A project without a
previous accepted verification or repair has no baseline for this check, so the
final from-scratch verification remains its gate.

## rbit build

Incrementally rebuild changed compiler and linker steps without CMake:

```console
rbit build .
```

`build` uses the compiler location remembered by `rbit setup`. It is the fast
incremental loop: it reuses a stored result only when every relevant input still
matches, then rebuilds the affected compiler steps and their downstream archive
or link steps, and finishes by listing each target output with its size. A
summary explains what was reused and why each rebuilt step was rebuilt (a step
built for the first time on this machine reads
`not cached on this machine yet (first build of this step)`). Use
`rbit build . --cold` for a non-certifying developer build with no cache reads
or writes. Both developer modes use the same current source files: edits to
already admitted files without affected reviewed interventions can build
without changing committed records. An edit that invalidates an intervention
still requires `repair`, including a shared header found in that compiler's
recursive inputs. Cold builds resolve those dependencies afresh before applying
reviewed transforms. `verify` always checks the committed source records.

`build`, `verify`, `repair`, and `discover grind` run independent steps in
parallel. Without `--jobs COUNT` the worker count is the number of CPUs the
process may use, capped at 8 (`rbit build --help` prints the rule as
`default: the CPUs this process may use, at most 8`). Pass `--jobs` to pin a
count; values below one are rejected with exit status 2.

### Matched comparison files

If an imported MSVC link asks for debug data, ReproBit automatically writes a
matched binary and `.PDB` inside the sibling `reprobit-debug/` directory. For
example, the pair for `build/GAME.EXE` is
`build/reprobit-debug/GAME.EXE` and `build/reprobit-debug/GAME.PDB`. Tools that
read symbols must use those two files together; do not mix the `.PDB` with the
declared `build/GAME.EXE`. The declared binary remains the only output used for
byte-exact certification or release. There are no extra paths to configure, and
incremental builds cache and restore both comparison files together. Export the
matching source view with [`source export`](#rbit-source-export) before running
a source-aware comparison tool.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: incremental cache and build isolation</summary>

The built-in MSVC adapter requires a valid local compiler installation, but
normal human runs resolve it from `rbit setup`. Plain `build` is a
non-certifying incremental developer build: the first run populates an
immutable project-local CAS, while an unchanged second run restores all nodes
without preparing the logical workspace or starting the shared Wine runtime. It emits
typed per-node hit/miss events in NDJSON and a compact text/NDJSON summary with
hit, miss, elapsed-time, invalidation, and backend-runtime start count. Use
`build --cold` to bypass and construct no cache state.

</details>

## rbit verify

Build every target from scratch and check exact bytes and trust evidence:

```console
rbit verify . --report-dir build/reprobit-report
```

`verify` always builds from scratch, has no warm/cache mode, and never opens
the cache. It writes the trust report as canonical JSON plus self-contained
HTML. When targets differ, the final message names them rather than reporting
only a count. Exit status 1 means the result did not satisfy the authenticity
policy.

### Reading the report

Open `build/reprobit-report/report.html` in a browser. Start with the overall
result and target summaries: they separately show whether the bytes match, the
saved adjustments passed their logic checks, the output came from the declared
toolchain, and the build started from scratch. Charts summarize build work and
adjustment cost when those details are available. Exact symbols, commands,
receipts, and canonical JSON stay available in collapsed Advanced sections.

<details>
<summary>Advanced: override machine paths and timeouts for one run</summary>

```console
rbit verify . \
  --toolchain-root /opt/toolchains/msvc42 \
  --compiler-transport /opt/toolchains/msvc42/wine/x86/cl \
  --resource-transport /opt/toolchains/msvc42/wine/x86/rc \
  --initialization-timeout 600 \
  --compile-timeout 600 \
  --link-timeout 900 \
  --cleanup-timeout 10 \
  --report-dir build/reprobit-report
```

The two transport options are supplied together on macOS and Linux. Native
Windows rejects those POSIX selectors. The initialization, compile/resource,
librarian/linker, and cleanup deadlines are independently bounded; their
defaults are 600, 600, 900, and 10 seconds. The same options apply to `build`,
`repair`, and `discover grind`; see
[advanced execution options](cli-reference.md#advanced-execution-options).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advanced: proof details</summary>

`verify` seals each reference binary before execution, builds in a new run
directory, audits current-run producer and intervention evidence, performs
literal comparison, and writes canonical JSON plus self-contained HTML. The two
transport options are only needed for an explicit POSIX override. Before
preparing a native producer arena it reruns the bounded
fresh-LUID lineage-drive probe and fails closed unless the host can admit a
suspended producer and preserve its drive through all producer descendants.
For a project-level `source_overlay_graph`, ReproBit derives a declaration
counterfactual before admitting effective primary products. Declaration-only
leaves require no extra compile. Strict semantic-delta leaves audit their exact
source owners; a strict header conservatively audits every ordinary compiler
because include exposure is not independently sealed. Each invocation is
covered by the compile timeout, and effective overlay receipts can carry
`certified-project-overlay` only after this sparse evidence passes.

The project authenticity policy is authoritative. A command-line policy
override may only narrow acceptance; it cannot silently broaden a clean project
to accept quarantine. Similarly, target and toolchain overrides are checked
against committed project identities.

</details>

## rbit discover init

Create a small automatic search plan without compiling. This is the expert
entry point for precise control over one function:

```console
rbit discover init . \
  --source src/widget.cpp \
  --symbol '?Transform@Widget@@QAEHH@Z' \
  --reference reference/widget.obj
```

`init` finds the matching compile step and writes a four-state plan
(`reprobit/discovery.json` by default) for
[`discover grind --expert-plan`](#rbit-discover-grind).

## rbit discover run

Run a bounded request file (advanced). `discover run REQUEST` is a broader
resumable campaign. It reports whole-function, private-donor, and same-symbol
mosaic proposals but does not save them. Raw proposals are not accepted by
certification commands; candidate exploration stays in ignored state. See the
[discovery guide](discovery.md) for the request format, incremental behavior,
progress events, and reports.

## rbit discover clean

Preview or remove one advanced discovery campaign's reusable state:

```console
rbit discover clean REQUEST --preview
rbit discover clean REQUEST
```

Cleanup removes the campaign's marker-owned reusable state and keeps the
reports. Pass the same `--state-directory` used by the
campaign when it was customized. Cleanup refuses state shared by several
request files unless `--all-requests` is given; preview that combined cleanup
before removing it.

## rbit discover grind

Search a bounded, project-wide set of low-cost adjustments. Use discovery when
a new project's first working build does not yet match its reference. (For a
later regression in a project that was already exact, use `rbit repair .`.)
The default is a read-only preview; repeat fresh proofs and save only when you
approve the result:

```console
rbit discover grind .
rbit discover grind . --accept-progress  # save proven work; follow its printed next step
rbit discover grind . --accept-exact     # require an exact project before saving anything
```

The printed approval, continuation, and verification commands preserve any
execution overrides you supplied, including compiler and Wine paths, worker
count, and timeouts. This also applies to commands in the review reports and
to `--expert-plan` runs. Automatic defaults are omitted so ordinary follow-ups
stay short.

Project-wide grind needs project-owned reference `.obj` files; it cannot derive
them from the reference executable alone. Put those objects under `reference/`
and name them after the source filename without its extension—for example,
`src/widget.cpp` maps to `reference/widget.obj`—or use the exact translation-unit
ID, or pair them explicitly with `--reference-object TU=PATH`. Before compiling,
the preview reports how many eligible compiler steps have an object, how many
are missing one, and how many functions it selected. Detailed pairings and skip
reasons remain in the report and NDJSON result. The preview tries a small
round-robin sample across eligible source files (`--max-symbols`) and
keeps its summary at `.reprobit-state/reports/grind/project/report.html`. Each
outcome links to a detailed decision report and a persisted bounded plan. Exact
previews show the copyable, platform-quoted approval command. If the whole
project is not exact, the report can instead offer `--accept-progress` for
functions that matched their project-owned reference objects and passed fresh
logic checks. It saves those adjustments one at a time and may itself reach an
exact project. Follow the printed next step: run another preview if mismatches
remain, or run `rbit verify .` after an exact result. `--accept-exact` is the
stricter path: it publishes nothing unless the current candidate makes the
complete project exact. Review changed files in `git diff`. Saved local
progress does not prove the complete project; only a fresh byte-exact result
does. Exit status 1 means nothing was found or nothing was saved.

The narrow save paths rerun the logic checks and rebuild from scratch:
`--accept-progress` saves only locally proven function adjustments;
`--accept-exact` saves only a complete byte-identical result.

With `--expert-plan reprobit/discovery.json` the command evaluates only the
plan written by [`discover init`](#rbit-discover-init). It writes
`.reprobit-state/reports/grind/report.html`; an exact preview includes its own
fresh approval command, while a locally proven result offers the progress
approval command. See the [discovery guide](discovery.md) for both workflows.

## rbit state status

Show retained runs, cache, reports, active leases, and disk usage:

```console
rbit state status .
```

`state status` reports reusable build and repair-search caches separately from
cache data left by older ReproBit code. It names the newest retained runs and
their outcomes, keeps a long run list brief, and prints the safe cleanup command
when it finds any. NDJSON includes the complete run list.

## rbit report

Validate JSON and render self-contained HTML from an existing report:

```console
rbit report build/reprobit-report/report.json
```

`report` strictly re-reads canonical report JSON before rendering HTML. The
input must be an existing file, and the HTML output must be a different path so
the canonical JSON cannot be overwritten.

## rbit cmake-module

Print the packaged CMake module path:

```console
rbit cmake-module --file
```

`cmake-module` prints the installed module directory, or the complete
`ReproBit.cmake` path with `--file`. The module is used only during CMake import
or refresh; normal `build` and `verify` runs do not load it.


## Exit status

Every command follows one contract, enforced in `reprobit.cli.main` and the
individual handlers:

| Code | Meaning | Commands that return it |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | The command completed and its result is ready, clean, or accepted. | all |
| 1 | An honest negative, not an error: the checks ran and the answer is "not yet". | `status` (project not ready), `doctor` (a check failed), `setup` (a backend check failed), `verify` (result not accepted under the policy), `discover grind` (nothing found or nothing saved) |
| 2 | Any error: usage errors, `--jobs` below one, a `CLIError`, an unreadable file, or any unexpected exception. The message starts with `error:`. | all |
| 130 | Interrupted with Ctrl-C; active child processes were asked to drain. | all |

A bounded grind can honestly find no useful new authority, so that outcome is
`1`. Repair starts from an already-exact project and promises to restore it;
if it cannot prove a safe complete repair, it refuses the operation as an error
and returns `2` without publishing partial authority or outputs.

## Machine-readable output

With `--format ndjson`, every line on standard output is one JSON object and
nothing else is written there (diagnostics that text mode sends to standard
error become events too). Keys are sorted, non-ASCII is kept, and NaN is
rejected. Invalid arguments are emitted as one `error` event too, so automation
does not need a separate parser for usage failures. `--help` and `--version`
remain ordinary human-readable text. Every object carries:

- `event` - the event name from the table below;
- `message` - human-readable text for command results and diagnostics;
- `schema_version` - `1`; consumers should reject an unknown version.

Progress is streamed as `workflow_progress` (phase started, finished, failed,
heartbeat) and `producer_progress` (unit finished, cache hit, cache miss)
events with the fields of `reprobit.progress.ProgressEvent`: `sequence`,
`kind`, `phase`, `message`, `elapsed_seconds` and, when present, `completed`,
`total`, `node_id`, `reason`. Progress messages retain machine-level detail;
text mode replaces internal phase and node names with concise friendly labels.

Events that offer a follow-up command include both `next_argv`, the exact
argument array for automation, and `next_command`, the same command rendered
for a person to copy. Where those fields are part of an event but no follow-up
is needed, they are `[]` and `null`.

Command events (from `CLIOutput.emit` call sites; paths and pydantic models are
serialized as strings and JSON objects):

(`CLIError` for expected failures).
